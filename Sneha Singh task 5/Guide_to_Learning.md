# GUIDE TOWARDS LEARNING GIT AND GITHUB

This is way to learn to **git and github** from beginning to basic concepts.
Let's start with basic concepts.
There are a ton of ways to use Git and GitHub, but getting started with GitHub doesn’t have to be overwhelming.
You don’t need to be some kind of master coder or anything.
You can even do the most important things right on the GitHub website!

>## Sign Up to **Github** and Installation of **Git Bash**
Go to GitHub and sign up for an account. You could just stop there and GitHub would work just fine.
In order to work on your local computer system you need to install Git Bash.
Now go to your terminal and introduce yourself to Git! 
To set your username for every repository on your computer,git command ` git config --global user.name "<your_name>" `.
If you want to set your name for just one repository, leave out the word “global" .
Now you can tell Git your email, and make sure it’s the same email you used when you signed up for GitHub,using git command
` git config --global user.email "<your_email_id>" `.
**Now you’re ready to start using Git on your computer!**.
